## Config

The installer will copy the packages.json file as its config. In order to further configure some installation settings, you can add the ``nodeWinInstaller`` property.

It is also possible to run the installer with a custom configuration. Simply choose ``y`` when asked: ``Use custom config? [y/n]``. After that you are asked to enter the path of your config file.

If no value for ``nodeWinInstaller`` exists the script continues with the [default config](https://github.com/lnoppinger/nodeWinInstaller/blob/main/default_config.json).
